A command line program that can be used to perform a series of convolution on a two-dimensional array with various sizes. Convolution plays an important role in many image processing  applications, and its operation is illustrated in figure below. Given a 5x5 image and a 3x3 kernel with  some predefined values, all you need to do is to (i) align the kernel to the image (which is an array),  (ii) extract the values from the image and multiply these value with the predefined values from the  kernel, (iii) sum all the values (after multiplication) from (ii), (iv) save the sum into another array, and  (v) repeat (i) to (iv) until you have slide the entire kernel over the entire image.
